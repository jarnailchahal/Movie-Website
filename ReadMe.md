About the application:

Authenticated users can access this application to get information about the latest movies that are currently playing in theatres. Moreover, they can search for any film to get information such as its genre, quick summary, and how others have rated it to decide if they'd like to watch it.  

It uses the movie org API(https://developers.themoviedb.org/) in the backend and sqlite3 db to store user credentials and the passport module (https://www.passportjs.org/) to authenticate users.
